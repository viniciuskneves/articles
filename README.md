> Vue 3 is coming with a some exciting new features. Composition API is the hottest one at the moment but there are others that excite me as much as it.
> One of those new features is called `Suspense` and it really excites me about the benefits it brings. You might have heard about it already but I will try to show some examples of the usage of `Suspense` and where it can be beneficial.

> I'm going to walk you through the process of creating [@Berlinglish](https://twitter.com/Berlinglish), a Twitter BOT that tweets Berlin's news in English for non-German speakers.

> I've been doing Vue, professionally, for a while now. As usual, whenever I create/setup a new project, I use Vue CLI which abstracts a lot of the heavy weight of creating a new project, which is great, especially if you've ever tried to setup a full Webpack config by yourself. The same applies if you use other CLIs to generate your project. Nonetheless, I want to walk through the process of setuping a Webpack config by myself and highlight some benefits and drawbacks of using Vue CLI on the way. I will try to mimic as much as possible the behavior of Vue CLI but avoid the usage of its plugins for example.
