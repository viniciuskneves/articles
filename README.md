## [Go async in Vue 3 with Suspense](./go-async-in-vue-3-with-suspense.md)

> Vue 3 is coming with a some exciting new features. Composition API is the hottest one at the moment but there are others that excite me as much as it. One of those new features is called `Suspense` and it really excites me about the benefits it brings. You might have heard about it already but I will try to show some examples of the usage of `Suspense` and where it can be beneficial.

## [Creating a Twitter BOT for Berlin English speakers](./creating-a-twitter-bot-for-berlin-english-speakers.md)

> I'm going to walk you through the process of creating [@Berlinglish](https://twitter.com/Berlinglish), a Twitter BOT that tweets Berlin's news in English for non-German speakers. The [project](https://github.com/viniciuskneves/berlinglish) was developed using Javascript. It is an AWS Lambda function that has an AWS CloudWatch scheduler as trigger. The function crawls Berlin's latest news and tweets it =]

## [Setup your own Webpack without a CLI](https://github.com/viniciuskneves/articles/tree/master/setup-your-own-webpack-without-a-cli)

> I've been doing Vue, professionally, for a while now. As usual, whenever I create/setup a new project, I use Vue CLI which abstracts a lot of the heavy weight of creating a new project, which is great, especially if you've ever tried to setup a full Webpack config by yourself. The same applies if you use other CLIs to generate your project. Nonetheless, I want to walk through the process of setuping a Webpack config by myself and highlight some benefits and drawbacks of using Vue CLI on the way. I will try to mimic as much as possible the behavior of Vue CLI but avoid the usage of its plugins for example.

## [Multiple builds targeting different browsers](./multiple-builds-targeting-different-browsers/README.md)

> How about building different versions of our applications targeting different browsers so each browser downloads only the "fallbacks" it needs? That is in short what I thought. Now I'm going to explore how is our current development lifecycle and where we can try to add this idea.

## [Vue custom input](./vue-custom-input.md)

> Building custom input components with Vue might sound simple but it has its gotchas and from time to time we end up going through the documentation to check some details. It can also get a bit complicated if we are not familiar with few Vue concepts.

## [Creating a GitHub Action for your Slack release BOT](./creating-a-github-action-for-your-slack-release-bot/README.md)

> I went through the process of creating a GitHub Action that posts a message as soon as a release happens (that is our use case) but the main topic is how you can automate things with GitHub Actions, how to reuse “things” across multiple actions and how to start “simple”.
